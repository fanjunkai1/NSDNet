## Network Architecture

<img src = "figs/framework.png" width='700' height='350'>

Overall pipeline of our non-aligned supervision framework with physical priors for the real-world image dehazing. It includes the mvSA and non-aligned supervision modules. mvSA can effectively estimate the infinite airlight A‚àû in real scenes. 
Our framework is different from the supervised dehazing models as it does not require aligned ground truths.



## Phone-Hazy Dataset

<img src = "figs/phone-hazy.png" width='700' height='250'>

Our phone-hazy dataset contains 415 non-aligned image pairs with four primary scenes: buildings, urban highways, rural cement roads, and outdoor landscapes. The haze levels mainly vary within a visibility range of 0 to 50 meters.
